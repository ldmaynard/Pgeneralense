Data from "Effects of climate change on plant resource allocation and herbivore interactions 
in a Neotropical rainforest shrub" 
by L.D. Maynard, E. Moureau, M.Y. Bader, D. Salazar, G. Zotz, S.R. Whitehead

Published in Ecology and Evolution 2022

All data were collected at La Selva Biological Station, Heredia Province, Costa Rica 
(Organization for Tropical Studies)

## Piper_growth.csv
Casa = individual chamber ID (A-T and 1-5)

Treatment = climate treatment (natural control, control chamber, CO2, T째C, T째C + CO2)

ht.2018.04.cm = plant height on x Apr 2018 (cm)

ht.2018.09.cm = plant height on x Sep 2018 (cm)

## Piper_herbivory.csv
ID = individual leaf ID (PG-#)

sample = phenolics sample individual ID (pg+chamber ID+leaf age)

age = leaf ag (M=mature, Y=young)

chamber = individual chamber ID (A-T and 1-5)

treatment = climate treatment (natural control, control chamber, CO2, T째C, T째C + CO2)

total area cm2 = total leaf area (cm^2)

real area cm2 = observed leaf area (cm^2)

percent_herbivory = amount of leaf missing/herbivore damage (%)

wt_mg = weight of collected leaf (mg)

## GA_StandardCurve.csv
Used to calculate proportion dry weight in gallic acid equivalents for samples

## Piper_phenolics.csv
chamber = individual chamber ID (A-T and 1-5)

sample = individual sample ID (pg+chamber ID+leaf age)

stage = leaf ag (m=mature, y=young)

plate = plate ID (in absorbance reading)

well = individual well ID (well-plate)

id = individual sample ID (well-sample)

start wt = starting aliquot of dried leaf tissue

abs1 = first absorbance reading

abs2 = second absorbance reading

abs3 = third absorbance reading

abs_avg = average of abs1:3
